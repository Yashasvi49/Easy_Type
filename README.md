# Bloggies

## Description

We have built a CRM model based blogging website where users can upload blogs, edit them and like.This site uses [React](https://react.dev/) for frontend.

We wanted to provide a space where users could easily discover, consume, and engage with content on topics of interest to them, while also fostering a sense of community and interaction among users.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
